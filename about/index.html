<p>Hi, my name is Sewell Stephens. I&#39;m a software developer and business owner with experience in building products and companies. I&#39;ve always had the dream of creating businesses that help people live better, and that drive started when I was young.</p>
<p>I first learned how to code in HTML when I was 12 years old. Even before that, I had countless business ideas - most of them offline. Eventually, I realized I wanted to build online products so I wouldn&#39;t need to deal with the expensive physical side of running a business, like storefronts or restaurants.</p>
<p>I am currently 20 years old and have been creating online sites and businesses for about eight years now. I&#39;ve had many ups and downs, but each one taught me something valuable, and I&#39;m still improving every day.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently working on Anchorclick, a done-for-you automation agency. Unlike other agencies, Anchorclick uses our in-house AutoAnchorJS library to handle desktop automation tasks where APIs aren&#39;t available or practical.</p>
