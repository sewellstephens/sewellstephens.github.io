# My Backstory

Hi, my name is Sewell Stephens. I'm a software developer and business owner with experience in building products and companies. I've always had the dream of creating businesses that help people live better, and that drive started when I was young.

I first learned how to code in HTML when I was 12 years old. Even before that, I had countless business ideas - most of them offline. Eventually, I realized I wanted to build online products so I wouldn't need to deal with the expensive physical side of running a business, like storefronts or restaurants.

I am currently 20 years old and have been creating online sites and businesses for about eight years now. I've had many ups and downs, but each one taught me something valuable, and I'm still improving every day.

I'm currently working on Anchorclick, a done-for-you automation agency. Unlike other agencies, Anchorclick uses our in-house AutoAnchorJS library to handle desktop automation tasks where APIs aren't available or practical.
